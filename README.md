# Evo-Agent-Engine
Evo-Agent Engine applies GEPA to treat the App World agent's instructions as a digital genome. Success parameters are a fitness function, guiding genetic selection to breed superior agent versions. This results in an autonomously adapting and , achieving maximum performance through simulated evolution.

# AppWorld + GEPA Autonomous Agent

This repository contains an autonomous agent that uses **DSPy** and **GEPA** to complete tasks in the **AppWorld** environment.  
The agent autonomously generates and executes Python code to solve realistic multi-step digital tasks using simulated app APIs.

---

## Overview

**AppWorld** is a benchmark for testing autonomous agents in realistic multi-application environments.  
It includes:

- A suite of simulated apps such as Spotify, Venmo, Gmail, and others  
- Hundreds of functional APIs representing real-world app interactions  
- Task scenarios that require reasoning, planning, and iterative API use  
- A safe Python sandbox where API calls are executed and observed step-by-step  

**GEPA (Genetic-Pareto Prompt Optimization)** is a prompt evolution algorithm integrated with **DSPy**.  
It improves model instructions by iteratively evaluating performance and rewriting the prompt based on multi-objective optimization — balancing task success rate, stability, and efficiency.

Together, they enable structured experimentation with autonomous agents that can plan, act, and self-improve through real environment feedback.

---

## How It Works

1. The agent receives a task description (e.g., “Find my Spotify password”).  
2. It generates Python code to call AppWorld APIs.  
3. The environment executes the code and returns structured output.  
4. The agent observes the result, updates its reasoning, and continues until completion.  
5. During optimization, **GEPA** refines the agent’s instructions based on past task performance.

## Installation and Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install appworld dspy gepa jinja2 openai

# Install and prepare the AppWorld environment
appworld install
appworld download data

# Set your Google API key for Gemini models
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
````

---

## Usage

Run one of the following modes:

```bash
python agent_appworld_gepa.py optimize
```

Optimize the agent’s instructions using GEPA on a random sample of development tasks.

```bash
python agent_appworld_gepa.py test_optimized
```

Evaluate the previously optimized agent on random test tasks.

```bash
python agent_appworld_gepa.py test_baseline
```

Run evaluation using the baseline (unoptimized) agent.

---

## Output

After optimization, evolved instructions are saved to:

```
optimized_agent_instructions_with_fewshot.txt
```

Console logs include:

* Code generated by the agent
* Environment output for each step
* Task completion summary
* Success and failure statistics across tasks

## Example Run

Below is a simplified example of how the agent interacts step-by-step:

```
==================== Step 1/30 ====================
--- Context Sent to LLM ---
Task Instruction: What is the password for my Spotify account?
History: [Empty]
--------------------------------
--- Code Generated by LLM ---
print(apis.api_docs.show_app_descriptions())
--------------------------------
--- Environment Output ---
[
  {"name": "supervisor", "description": "Access personal information and credentials."},
  {"name": "spotify", "description": "A music streaming service."}
]
--------------------------------

==================== Step 2/30 ====================
--- Code Generated by LLM ---
print(apis.api_docs.show_api_descriptions(app_name='supervisor'))
--------------------------------
--- Environment Output ---
["show_account_passwords : Show your supervisor's app account passwords."]
--------------------------------

==================== Step 3/30 ====================
--- Code Generated by LLM ---
print(apis.supervisor.show_account_passwords())
--------------------------------
--- Environment Output ---
[
  {"account_name": "spotify", "password": "dummy_spotify_pass"}
]
--------------------------------

==================== Step 4/30 ====================
--- Code Generated by LLM ---
apis.supervisor.complete_task(answer="dummy_spotify_pass")
--------------------------------
--- Environment Output ---
Marked the active task complete.
--------------------------------

Evaluation Success
```

## Summary

This project demonstrates how autonomous language model agents can operate in interactive digital environments.
By combining **AppWorld’s** realistic simulation with **GEPA’s** adaptive optimization, the system can self-improve over time through direct execution feedback rather than static datasets.
